# Auto-Update

### Relief at the double click of the index finger. 

I created this program because I got so sick of opening Terminal and typing in `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y` every day. This will bring great relief to those that feel the same way. 

#### How to make it executable
1. Open terminal
2. Go to the folder that contains the file `Auto-update.sh`
3. When you see the file when typing `ls`, type in `chmod +x Auto-update.sh`
4. The file is now executable. Type in `./Auto-update.sh`
5. Enjoy that magic!
