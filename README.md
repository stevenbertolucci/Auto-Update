# Auto-Update

### Relief at the double click of the index finger. 

I created this program because I got so sick of opening Terminal and typing in `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y` every day. This will bring great relief to those that feel the same way. 

## Setup Instructions

### Option 1
1. Download the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stevenbertolucci/Auto-Update.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd Auto-Update
    ```
3. Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
4. The program is now ready! You should see a desktop icon labeled "Your Program" that you can double-click to run the script.

### Option 2
1. Open terminal
2. Go to the folder that contains the file `Auto-update.sh`
3. When you see the file when typing `ls`, type in `chmod +x Auto-update.sh`
4. The file is now executable. Type in `./Auto-update.sh`
5. Enjoy that magic!
